# PA04

## Description
A recreation of PA03 as an Express Application with MongoDB through Mongoose.

## Projects

## firstapp

## myapp
A project created on version 19.9.0 because I was unable to get firstapp to work on my machine, no discredit to Eric's work on that application. 

### Current Status
The infrastructure of the application has been created as well as the add and show transaction features. 

### Remaining Work
#### Group By Category
I think this can be just a general button in the center of the screen above the transaction table.
#### Sort Buttons
I think it would be awesome to make the buttons as the table headers for a sleek interface, similar to the way I made the store button a table databox.
#### Edit and Delete Functionality
I have created space for them within the transaction table but did not implement them to leave enough work for everyoen to contribute. I think it would be cool to implement that sleek look of a button within the table databox. The CSS should carry over for you.
